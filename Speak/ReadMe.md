# Speak Processor
This utility combined with the power of **SpotAssist** enables you to make any text to speak out loud. Just copy the content of `speak.zip` in the same locaiton as your `SpotAssist.exe` is running and see the magic.

## How it works?
If you have some text in `Notepad` or wherever you can prefix a line and copy, then it works from anywhere. Just do the following:

```
~>process-speak
This text will be read out loud in Male voice.
```

And if you want to have **Female** voice instead, you need to suffix an additional line as follows:
```
~>process-speak
This text will be read out loud in Female voice.
<~female
```

# That's it!
